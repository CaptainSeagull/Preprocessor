# Preprocessor


# Overview

This is a simple project in order to allow more complex meta programming in C/C++. The utility generates code, which should be included in the relavent .cpp file, which will allow more advanced introspection than C/C++ currently allows.
Build instructions

Windows: Simple call the build.bat file from the command line (after calling vcvarsall.bat). This will generate the .exe, which should be completely portable (not even requiring the win32 crt).

Linux: Instructions are very similar, but sadly I haven't had time to properly test them yet.

Mac: N/A.
