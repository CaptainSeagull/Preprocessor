/*input a min value >> input a max value

Computer will do a random number generation between those values
>> output the generated number

Computer will ask "Is this the number you are thinking of?"

>> IF the computer's number is higher than your number, input "too high" THEN the computer will reduce the max value to the guessed number.
(eg. if you input a value of between 1 and 10, and computer guesses 7, and 7 is too high, then the random number MAX value will change to 6. Then the computer will generate random number between 1 and 6!)

>> IF the computer's number is lower than your number, input "too low", THEN the computer will increase the min value to it's guessed number(between 1 and 10, if 5 is too low, the min and max values of the random number gen change to between 6 and 10)

These cycles will continue until the computer guesses the number you are thinking of.When the computer guesses your number, and you input "yes", the computer will say "I won! :)"

THe computer then asks "do you want to play again?" if yes, recycle program, if no, close program.*/
